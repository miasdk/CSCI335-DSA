## Question 1: Processor Architecture Concepts (10 points)

### Question:
For each of the following statements, indicate whether it is TRUE or FALSE, and provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for your answer.

a) In a single-cycle MIPS architecture, the clock period must be long enough to accommodate the slowest instruction.

b) Multi-cycle MIPS generally has a higher CPI than single-cycle MIPS, but can still provide better overall performance.

c) In a pipelined architecture, adding more pipeline stages always improves performance.

d) Structural hazards occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction still in the pipeline.

e) Branch prediction can completely eliminate the performance impact of control hazards.

### Solution:

### a) In a single-cycle MIPS architecture, the clock period must be long enough to accommodate the slowest instruction.

**TRUE**

In a single-cycle architecture, each instruction must complete in exactly one clock cycle. This means that the clock period must be long enough to accommodate the longest-latency instruction path (typically the load word instruction, which requires instruction fetch, register read, ALU operation, data memory access, and register write). All instructions, even simple ones, must wait for this same clock period.

### b) Multi-cycle MIPS generally has a higher CPI than single-cycle MIPS, but can still provide better overall performance.

**TRUE**

In single-cycle MIPS, CPI = 1 by definition. Multi-cycle MIPS breaks instructions into steps, with each instruction taking 3-5 cycles depending on type, resulting in CPI > 1. However, the clock period can be significantly shorter in multi-cycle (determined by the longest individual step rather than the longest complete instruction), which can more than compensate for the increased CPI, leading to better overall performance (execution time = instruction count × CPI × clock period).

### c) In a pipelined architecture, adding more pipeline stages always improves performance.

**FALSE**

Adding more pipeline stages can reduce the clock period by breaking the critical path into smaller segments. However, it also increases hazard penalties, adds pipeline register overhead, and can reduce the amount of useful work done per cycle. Beyond a certain point, these diminishing returns and increased hazards outweigh the benefits of a shorter clock period. There's an optimal number of pipeline stages that balances these factors for a given architecture.

### d) Structural hazards occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction still in the pipeline.

**FALSE**

This describes a data hazard, not a structural hazard. Structural hazards occur when two instructions need to use the same hardware resource (like memory or register file) simultaneously. Data hazards occur when an instruction depends on data produced by an earlier instruction still in the pipeline. Control hazards occur when the flow of instruction execution depends on the outcome of a branch or jump instruction.

### e) Branch prediction can completely eliminate the performance impact of control hazards.

**FALSE**

While branch prediction can significantly reduce the performance impact of control hazards, it cannot completely eliminate it for two reasons: (1) No prediction mechanism is 100% accurate, and mispredictions still incur penalty cycles, and (2) Even with correct prediction, there's some overhead in the prediction mechanism itself. The best we can do is minimize the impact through increasingly sophisticated prediction techniques.

## Question 2: Critical Path Analysis (15 points)

### Question:
Consider a single-cycle MIPS processor with the following component delays:
- MUX: 3 ps
- Control Unit, ALU Control: 5 ps
- ALU: 90 ps
- Adder: 55 ps
- Registers (PC, etc.): 4 ps read, 6 ps write
- Memory (data, instruction): 75 ps read, 85 ps write
- Register File: 32 ps read, 38 ps write

a) Identify the critical path for an R-type instruction (8 points)

b) Identify the critical path for a load (lw) instruction (7 points)

For each path, list the components traversed and calculate the total delay.

### Solution:

### a) Identify the critical path for an R-type instruction (8 points)

The critical path for an R-type instruction in a single-cycle architecture:

1. PC read (4 ps)
2. Instruction Memory read (75 ps)
3. Register File read (32 ps)
4. ALU operation (90 ps)
5. Register File write (38 ps)
6. Control Unit delay (5 ps)
7. MUX for RegisterFile destination selection (3 ps)
8. MUX for ALU second input selection (3 ps)

Total critical path delay = 4 + 75 + 5 + 32 + 3 + 90 + 38 = **250 ps**

### b) Identify the critical path for a load (lw) instruction (7 points)

The critical path for a load (lw) instruction:

1. PC read (4 ps)
2. Instruction Memory read (75 ps)
3. Register File read (32 ps)
4. ALU operation (address calculation) (90 ps)
5. Data Memory read (75 ps)
6. Register File write (38 ps)
7. Control Unit delay (5 ps)
8. MUX for ALU second input (3 ps)
9. MUX for Register write data (3 ps)

Total critical path delay = 4 + 75 + 5 + 32 + 3 + 90 + 75 + 3 + 38 = **325 ps**

The load instruction has the longer critical path and would determine the clock period for the single-cycle architecture.

---

## Question 3: Performance Comparison (15 points)

### Question:
Consider three implementations of the MIPS architecture (single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined) with the component delays given in Question 2. The instruction mix for a benchmark program is:
- 60% R-type
- 20% branch
- 12% load
- 5% store
- 3% jump

a) Calculate the maximum clock rate that each architecture can run at. (6 points)

b) For the multi-cycle MIPS, assume R-type instructions take 4 cycles, loads take 5 cycles, stores take 4 cycles, branches take 3 cycles, and jumps take 3 cycles. Calculate the average CPI. (3 points)

c) For the pipelined MIPS, assume a branch prediction accuracy of 90% with a 3-cycle penalty for misprediction. Calculate the effective CPI. (3 points)

d) Calculate the effective MIPS rating for each architecture when running this benchmark. (3 points)

### Solution:

### a) Calculate the maximum clock rate that each architecture can run at. (6 points)

**Single-cycle MIPS:**
The clock period is determined by the longest instruction path, which is the load instruction at 325 ps (from Question 2b).
Maximum clock rate = 1 / 325 ps = **3.077 GHz**

**Multi-cycle MIPS:**
The clock period is determined by the longest individual stage:
- Instruction fetch: PC (4 ps) + Instruction Memory (75 ps) = 79 ps
- Register read: Register File (32 ps) = 32 ps
- ALU operation: ALU (90 ps) + MUX (3 ps) = 93 ps
- Memory access: Data Memory (75 ps) = 75 ps
- Register write: Register File (38 ps) + MUX (3 ps) = 41 ps

The longest stage is ALU operation at 93 ps, which sets the clock period.
Maximum clock rate = 1 / 93 ps = **10.753 GHz**

**Pipelined MIPS:**
The clock period is determined by the slowest pipeline stage, plus overhead for pipeline registers (typically about 5 ps per register).
Longest stage is ALU operation: 93 ps + 5 ps = 98 ps
Maximum clock rate = 1 / 98 ps = **10.204 GHz**

### b) For the multi-cycle MIPS, calculate the average CPI. (3 points)

- R-type instructions (60%): 4 cycles
- Branch instructions (20%): 3 cycles
- Load instructions (12%): 5 cycles
- Store instructions (5%): 4 cycles
- Jump instructions (3%): 3 cycles

Average CPI = (0.60 × 4) + (0.20 × 3) + (0.12 × 5) + (0.05 × 4) + (0.03 × 3)
           = 2.4 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.2 + 0.09
           = **3.89 cycles/instruction**

### c) For the pipelined MIPS, calculate the effective CPI. (3 points)

Ideal CPI in a pipelined architecture is 1 cycle/instruction.
Branch frequency = 20%
Branch misprediction rate = 10% (since prediction accuracy is 90%)
Misprediction penalty = 3 cycles

Effective CPI = Ideal CPI + (Branch frequency × Misprediction rate × Penalty)
              = 1 + (0.20 × 0.10 × 3)
              = 1 + 0.06
              = **1.06 cycles/instruction**

### d) Calculate the effective MIPS rating for each architecture when running this benchmark. (3 points)

**Single-cycle MIPS:**
MIPS = Clock rate (MHz) / CPI
     = 3,077 MHz / 1
     = **3,077 MIPS**

**Multi-cycle MIPS:**
MIPS = Clock rate (MHz) / CPI
     = 10,753 MHz / 3.89
     = **2,764 MIPS**

**Pipelined MIPS:**
MIPS = Clock rate (MHz) / CPI
     = 10,204 MHz / 1.06
     = **9,626 MIPS**

The pipelined architecture delivers the highest performance, followed by the single-cycle architecture, with the multi-cycle architecture performing the worst for this particular instruction mix and component delays.

## Question 4: Branch Prediction (10 points)

### Question:
a) A pipelined processor uses a 2-bit saturating counter for branch prediction. Starting from the "Strongly Not Taken" state, show the state transitions for the following sequence of branch outcomes (T = taken, N = not taken): N, N, T, T, T, N, T, N, N. (5 points)

b) In a pipelined MIPS processor running at 3 GHz, branch instructions account for 18% of all instructions. The branch predictor has an accuracy of 92%, and each misprediction results in a 4-cycle penalty. What is the processor's throughput in MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)? (5 points)

### Solution:

### a) 2-bit saturating counter state transitions (5 points)

Starting from "Strongly Not Taken" (00), the state transitions for the sequence N, N, T, T, T, N, T, N, N:

1. Initial state: Strongly Not Taken (00)
2. Branch outcome N: Stay in Strongly Not Taken (00)
3. Branch outcome N: Stay in Strongly Not Taken (00)
4. Branch outcome T: Move to Weakly Not Taken (01)
5. Branch outcome T: Move to Weakly Taken (10)
6. Branch outcome T: Move to Strongly Taken (11)
7. Branch outcome N: Move to Weakly Taken (10)
8. Branch outcome T: Move to Strongly Taken (11)
9. Branch outcome N: Move to Weakly Taken (10)
10. Branch outcome N: Move to Weakly Not Taken (01)

Final state: Weakly Not Taken (01)

### b) Processor throughput calculation (5 points)

Given:
- Processor clock rate = 3 GHz
- Branch frequency = 18%
- Branch predictor accuracy = 92% (misprediction rate = 8%)
- Misprediction penalty = 4 cycles

Step 1: Calculate effective CPI
Effective CPI = 1 + (Branch frequency × Misprediction rate × Penalty)
              = 1 + (0.18 × 0.08 × 4)
              = 1 + 0.0576
              = 1.0576 cycles/instruction

Step 2: Calculate throughput in MIPS
MIPS = (Clock rate) / (CPI × 10^6)
     = (3 × 10^9) / (1.0576 × 10^6)
     = 3 × 10^3 / 1.0576
     = **2,837 MIPS**

The processor's throughput is approximately 2.837 billion instructions per second.

## Question 6: MIPS Instruction from Datapath Diagram (15 points)

### Question:
Figure 4.57 from your textbook (shown below) displays a close-up of a MIPS datapath with a 2:1 multiplexer added to select the signed immediate as an ALU input. Based on this diagram, answer the following questions:

![Figure 4.57: A close-up of the datapath showing a 2:1 multiplexer for selecting signed immediate as ALU input]

a) What MIPS instruction is this datapath designed to implement? Describe the operation in both English and RTL notation.

b) Write the machine code format for this instruction, showing all fields and their sizes.

c) Write an example of this instruction in MIPS assembly language, and show the corresponding machine code in hexadecimal.

d) Explain how the datapath executes this instruction step-by-step, including the role of each component shown in the diagram.

### Solution:

#### Part a) Instruction identification and description

The diagram shows a datapath modified to handle I-type instructions that use immediate values as one of the ALU inputs. This is evident from the highlighted 2:1 multiplexer (ALUSrc) that selects between a register value and a sign-extended immediate value.

While this datapath supports multiple I-type instructions, the most common and representative instruction is the **Load Word (LW)** instruction.

**Operation in English**: Load Word loads a 32-bit word from memory at the address calculated by adding a sign-extended 16-bit immediate offset to the contents of a base register (rs), and places the result in register rt.

**RTL Notation**: R[rt] ← Memory[R[rs] + SignExt(immediate)]

#### Part b) Machine code format

The Load Word (LW) instruction uses the I-type format:

```
| opcode (6 bits) | rs (5 bits) | rt (5 bits) | immediate (16 bits) |
|     100011      |    sssss    |    ttttt    |   iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  |
```

- Opcode: 100011 (35 in decimal) - identifies this as a LW instruction
- rs: 5-bit base register address (source for memory address calculation)
- rt: 5-bit destination register address (where loaded data will be stored)
- immediate: 16-bit offset value (sign-extended for address calculation)

#### Part c) Example instruction and machine code

**MIPS Assembly**:
```
lw $t0, 8($s0)   # Load word from memory at address $s0+8 into register $t0
```

**Machine Code**:
- Opcode: 100011 (LW)
- rs: $s0 = 10000 (register 16)
- rt: $t0 = 01000 (register 8)
- immediate: 8 = 0000000000001000

Binary: 10001110000010000000000000001000
Hexadecimal: 0x8E080008

#### Part d) Execution step-by-step

The execution of a Load Word instruction in the pipelined datapath shown proceeds through the following steps:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF) Stage** (not shown in this diagram):
   - The instruction is fetched from instruction memory
   - The PC is incremented

2. **Instruction Decode (ID) Stage**:
   - The instruction is decoded, identifying it as LW
   - Control signals are generated, including setting ALUSrc = 1 to select the immediate value
   - Register values are read from the register file (rs for base address)
   - The 16-bit immediate value is sign-extended to 32 bits
   - All values are passed to the ID/EX pipeline register

3. **Execute (EX) Stage**:
   - The ALUSrc multiplexer (highlighted in blue) selects the sign-extended immediate value
   - The ALU adds the base register value and immediate to calculate the memory address
   - The ALU result (memory address) and data to be stored are passed to the EX/MEM pipeline register

4. **Memory (MEM) Stage**:
   - The calculated address is sent to data memory
   - Data is read from memory at this address
   - The memory data and destination register information are passed to the MEM/WB pipeline register

5. **Write Back (WB) Stage**:
   - The MUX in the WB stage selects data from memory
   - This data is written back to the destination register (rt)

**Forwarding Unit Role**: The diagram shows a forwarding unit that monitors dependencies between instructions and can route data directly from the ALU output or memory output back to the ALU inputs, bypassing the register file when a value is needed before it has been written back.

The specific datapath elements from the diagram that play key roles:
- **ALUSrc Multiplexer**: Selects the immediate value instead of a register value as the second ALU input
- **Forwarding Multiplexers**: Allow bypassing the register file when data dependencies exist
- **ALU**: Computes the memory address by adding the base register value and the immediate offset
- **Data Memory**: Retrieves the data from the calculated address
- **Write-Back Multiplexer**: Selects the data from memory to be written to the register file

This implementation efficiently handles the LW instruction while supporting forwarding to minimize pipeline stalls due to data hazards.

## Question 7: Custom Instruction Implementation (15 points)

### Question:
Consider a new instruction for the MIPS architecture called "Swap Memory" (swpm $rt, offset($rs)). This instruction swaps the contents of register $rt with the contents of the memory location at address $rs + offset.

a) Design the machine code format for this instruction. (3 points)

b) List the sequence of operations required to execute this instruction in RTL (Register Transfer Language). (4 points)

c) For a single-cycle implementation, identify any new datapath elements or modifications needed. (4 points)

d) Complete the control signal settings for this instruction in the single-cycle MIPS control table. (4 points)

### Solution:

### a) Machine code format for "Swap Memory" (3 points)

Since this instruction uses two registers ($rs and $rt) and an immediate value (offset), the I-type format is most appropriate:

```
| opcode (6 bits) | rs (5 bits) | rt (5 bits) | offset (16 bits) |
```

We would assign a new opcode value that isn't already used by MIPS (e.g., 101101).

### b) Sequence of operations in RTL (4 points)

The swap memory instruction requires the following operations:

1. TEMP ← M[R[rs] + SignExt(offset)]  # Read memory value into temporary register
2. M[R[rs] + SignExt(offset)] ← R[rt]  # Store register value to memory
3. R[rt] ← TEMP                        # Update register with memory value

### c) New datapath elements or modifications needed (4 points)

For a single-cycle implementation, we need:

1. A temporary register to hold the memory value being swapped
2. Additional control path to manage the data flow for the swap operation
3. Modified ALU control to handle the new operation
4. Data path from memory to the temporary register and from the temporary register to the register file

The key addition is the temporary register, which isn't needed for existing MIPS instructions. We also need to modify the control unit to produce the correct sequence of control signals.

### d) Control signal settings for single-cycle MIPS (4 points)

| Control Signal | Value | Explanation |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| RegDst         | 0     | Destination is rt field |
| ALUSrc         | 1     | ALU uses immediate offset |
| MemtoReg       | 1     | Register value comes from memory |
| RegWrite       | 1     | Enable writing to register file |
| MemRead        | 1     | Enable reading from memory |
| MemWrite       | 1     | Enable writing to memory |
| Branch         | 0     | Not a branch instruction |
| ALUOp          | 00    | ALU performs addition (for address) |
| Jump           | 0     | Not a jump instruction |
| TempRegWrite   | 1     | New signal to enable writing to temporary register |

Note: A single-cycle implementation of this instruction is challenging because it requires sequential memory access (read then write), which contradicts the single-cycle paradigm. In practice, this would likely require a multi-cycle implementation or a more complex memory system that can perform both operations in one cycle.

## Question 8: Pipeline Hazards and Solutions (15 points)

### Question:
Consider the following sequence of MIPS instructions:

```
lw    $t0, 0($s0)    # Load word from memory at address $s0 into $t0
add   $t1, $t0, $s1  # $t1 = $t0 + $s1
sub   $t2, $t1, $s2  # $t2 = $t1 - $s2
sw    $t2, 4($s0)    # Store $t2 to memory at address $s0 + 4
beq   $t2, $0, label # Branch to label if $t2 equals zero
and   $t3, $s3, $s4  # $t3 = $s3 & $s4
or    $t4, $s5, $s6  # $t4 = $s5 | $s6
```

a) Identify all data hazards in this instruction sequence. For each hazard, specify the type and the instructions involved. (6 points)

b) Show how forwarding can be used to resolve the data hazards. For each forwarding case, indicate the source and destination of the forwarded data. (5 points)

c) Identify any hazards that cannot be resolved by forwarding alone and explain how they would be handled. (4 points)

### Solution:

### a) Identify all data hazards (6 points)

Looking at the instruction sequence:

```
lw    $t0, 0($s0)    # Instruction 1
add   $t1, $t0, $s1  # Instruction 2
sub   $t2, $t1, $s2  # Instruction 3
sw    $t2, 4($s0)    # Instruction 4
beq   $t2, $0, label # Instruction 5
and   $t3, $s3, $s4  # Instruction 6
or    $t4, $s5, $s6  # Instruction 7
```

Data hazards:

1. **RAW hazard between instructions 1 and 2**: Instruction 2 (add) needs $t0, which is being loaded by instruction 1 (lw). This is a load-use hazard.

2. **RAW hazard between instructions 2 and 3**: Instruction 3 (sub) needs $t1, which is being calculated by instruction 2 (add).

3. **RAW hazard between instructions 3 and 4**: Instruction 4 (sw) needs $t2, which is being calculated by instruction 3 (sub).

4. **RAW hazard between instructions 3 and 5**: Instruction 5 (beq) needs $t2, which is being calculated by instruction 3 (sub).

### b) Using forwarding to resolve hazards (5 points)

1. **Hazard between instructions 1 and 2 (load-use hazard)**: 
   - Cannot be fully resolved by forwarding because the data from memory isn't available until after the MEM stage of the lw instruction
   - Requires a stall (discussed in part c)

2. **Hazard between instructions 2 and 3**:
   - Forward from the EX/MEM pipeline register (after instruction 2's EX stage)
   - Forward to the ALU input in instruction 3's EX stage
   - Source: EX/MEM.ALUResult
   - Destination: ALU input A

3. **Hazard between instructions 3 and 4**:
   - Forward from the EX/MEM pipeline register (after instruction 3's EX stage)
   - Forward to the write data input in instruction 4's MEM stage
   - Source: EX/MEM.ALUResult
   - Destination: MEM.WriteData

4. **Hazard between instructions 3 and 5**:
   - Forward from the EX/MEM pipeline register (after instruction 3's EX stage)
   - Forward to the comparator input in instruction 5's EX stage
   - Source: EX/MEM.ALUResult
   - Destination: Branch comparator input A

### c) Hazards that cannot be resolved by forwarding (4 points)

The load-use hazard between instructions 1 and 2 cannot be fully resolved by forwarding alone. This is because:

1. Instruction 1 (lw) loads data from memory in its MEM stage
2. Instruction 2 (add) needs this data in its EX stage
3. In a typical 5-stage pipeline, instruction 2 would be in EX when instruction 1 is in MEM

Since the data isn't available in time, we need to stall the pipeline:
- Stall instruction 2 and all following instructions for one cycle
- This can be implemented by:
  - Holding the IF/ID pipeline register constant (not updating it)
  - Injecting a bubble (NOP) into the ID/EX pipeline register
  - After the stall, forwarding can be used to pass the data from the MEM/WB pipeline register to the ALU input

The pipeline execution with stall:
```
Cycle 1: lw (IF)
Cycle 2: lw (ID), add (IF)
Cycle 3: lw (EX), add (ID)
Cycle 4: lw (MEM), add (ID) [STALL]
Cycle 5: lw (WB), add (EX) [FORWARD]
Cycle 6: sub (ID), add (MEM)
```

## BONUS Question: Optimizing Component Delays (5 points)

### Question:
In the processor described in Question 2, your design team needs to reduce power consumption by slowing down one component. Which component would you choose to slow down, and by how much could it be slowed without affecting the overall performance? Justify your answer with calculations.

### Solution:

To determine which component can be slowed down without affecting performance, we need to identify components that are not on the critical path, or that have "slack" in their timing.

From our analysis in Question 2, the critical path for the slowest instruction (load word) is:
PC → Instruction Memory → Register File → ALU → Data Memory → Register File
With a total delay of 325 ps.

Since the Register File write (38 ps) is the last component on this path, we could slow it down without affecting other parts of the critical path. 

The next slower instruction path is for the R-type instructions at 250 ps, which is 75 ps faster than the load instruction. This gives us a "slack" of 75 ps in the Register File write operation.

Therefore, we could slow down the Register File write from 38 ps to 38 + 75 = 113 ps without affecting the overall processor performance. This is a substantial reduction in speed (and thus power) by a factor of almost 3x.

Alternatively, we could slow down the Data Memory read (currently 75 ps) by up to 75 ps to 150 ps, since it's only used in the load instruction which already determines the clock period.

The choice between these two depends on which component consumes more power and would benefit more from being slowed down. Since memory operations typically consume more power than register operations, slowing down the Data Memory would likely provide more power savings.

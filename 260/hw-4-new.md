## Performance Analysis

### Understanding Critical Path Analysis

Before diving into the solutions, let's understand what critical path analysis is and why it matters:

The **critical path** is the longest sequence of dependent operations that determines the minimum time required for instruction execution. It sets the lower bound for the clock period in a synchronous system.

For calculating maximum clock rate:
- Identify the longest path through the processor for each instruction type
- Sum the delays of all components in this path
- The maximum clock rate = 1 / (critical path delay)

### Component Delays (for reference)
- MUX: 2 ps
- Control Unit, ALU Control: 6 ps
- ALU: 100 ps
- Adder: 60 ps
- Registers (PC, IR, MDR, A, B, ALUOut, Pipelines): 3 ps read, 5 ps write
- Memory (data, instruction): 70 ps read, 90 ps write
- Register File: 30 ps read, 40 ps write

### Instruction Mix (for reference)
- 64% R-type
- 15% branch
- 10% load
- 6% store
- 5% jump

### Single-Cycle MIPS Analysis

#### Critical Path Analysis for Single-Cycle

In a single-cycle architecture, all instructions complete in one cycle, so we need to find the instruction with the longest path. Let's analyze each instruction type:

1. **R-type instruction path**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - Register file read (30 ps)
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - Register file write (40 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 2 = 4 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 30 + 100 + 40 + 6 + 4 = **253 ps**

2. **Load instruction path**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - Register file read (30 ps)
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - Data memory read (70 ps)
   - Register file write (40 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 3 = 6 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 30 + 100 + 70 + 40 + 6 + 6 = **325 ps**

3. **Store instruction path**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - Register file read (30 ps × 2 = 60 ps) (both base and value registers)
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - Data memory write (90 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 2 = 4 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 60 + 100 + 90 + 6 + 4 = **333 ps**

4. **Branch instruction path**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - Register file read (30 ps × 2 = 60 ps)
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - Adder for branch target (60 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 2 = 4 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 60 + 100 + 60 + 6 + 4 = **303 ps**

5. **Jump instruction path**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - Jump address calculation (negligible)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 6 + 2 = **81 ps**

The critical path is determined by the **store instruction** at **333 ps**.

#### Maximum Clock Rate
Maximum clock rate = 1 / critical path delay = 1 / 333 ps = **3.00 GHz**

#### Effective MIPS Rating
The MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) rating is calculated as:
MIPS = (Clock rate in MHz) / CPI

For single-cycle, CPI = 1 (by definition)
MIPS = 3,000 MHz / 1 = **3,000 MIPS**

### Multi-Cycle MIPS Analysis

#### Critical Path Analysis for Multi-Cycle

In multi-cycle architecture, each instruction is broken into multiple steps, with each step taking one cycle. The clock period is determined by the longest step, not the longest instruction.

Let's analyze each stage:

1. **Instruction Fetch**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - IR write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 5 + 6 + 2 = **86 ps**

2. **Instruction Decode / Register Fetch**:
   - Register file read (30 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - Total: 30 + 6 = **36 ps**

3. **ALU Operation (Execute)**:
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - ALUOut write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 2 = 4 ps)
   - Total: 100 + 5 + 6 + 4 = **115 ps**

4. **Memory Access**:
   - Data memory read/write (70 ps for read, 90 ps for write)
   - MDR write (5 ps) (for read operations)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total (read): 70 + 5 + 6 + 2 = **83 ps**
   - Total (write): 90 + 6 + 2 = **98 ps**

5. **Write Back**:
   - Register file write (40 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total: 40 + 6 + 2 = **48 ps**

The critical path is determined by the **ALU Operation stage** at **115 ps**.

#### Maximum Clock Rate
Maximum clock rate = 1 / critical path delay = 1 / 115 ps = **8.70 GHz**

#### Average CPI Calculation
For a multi-cycle implementation, we need to consider how many cycles each instruction type takes:
- R-type: 4 cycles
- Load: 5 cycles
- Store: 4 cycles
- Branch: 3 cycles
- Jump: 3 cycles

Average CPI = (64% × 4) + (15% × 3) + (10% × 5) + (6% × 4) + (5% × 3)
= 2.56 + 0.45 + 0.5 + 0.24 + 0.15
= **3.9 cycles**

#### Effective MIPS Rating
MIPS = (Clock rate in MHz) / CPI
= 8,700 MHz / 3.9
= **2,231 MIPS**

### Pipelined MIPS Analysis

#### Critical Path Analysis for Pipelined MIPS

In a pipelined architecture, the clock period is determined by the slowest pipeline stage plus the overhead from pipeline registers.

Let's analyze each pipeline stage:

1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**:
   - PC read (3 ps)
   - Instruction memory read (70 ps)
   - IF/ID pipeline register write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total: 3 + 70 + 5 + 6 + 2 = **86 ps**

2. **ID (Instruction Decode / Register Fetch)**:
   - Register file read (30 ps)
   - ID/EX pipeline register write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - Adder for branch target (60 ps) (for branches)
   - Total: 30 + 5 + 6 = **41 ps** (regular)
   - Total: 30 + 5 + 6 + 60 = **101 ps** (branches)

3. **EX (Execute)**:
   - ALU operation (100 ps)
   - EX/MEM pipeline register write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delays (2 ps × 2 = 4 ps)
   - Total: 100 + 5 + 6 + 4 = **115 ps**

4. **MEM (Memory Access)**:
   - Data memory access (70 ps read, 90 ps write)
   - MEM/WB pipeline register write (5 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total (read): 70 + 5 + 6 + 2 = **83 ps**
   - Total (write): 90 + 5 + 6 + 2 = **103 ps**

5. **WB (Write Back)**:
   - Register file write (40 ps)
   - Control unit delay (6 ps)
   - MUX delay (2 ps)
   - Total: 40 + 6 + 2 = **48 ps**

The critical path is determined by the **EX stage** at **115 ps**.

#### Maximum Clock Rate
Maximum clock rate = 1 / critical path delay = 1 / 115 ps = **8.70 GHz**

#### Effective MIPS Rating

For a pipelined processor, we need to consider best and worst case scenarios:

**Best Case**: Ideal pipeline with no hazards.
- CPI approaches 1 as the number of instructions increases
- MIPS = 8,700 MHz / 1 = **8,700 MIPS**

**Worst Case**: Significant hazards causing stalls.
Let's assume a conservative worst-case CPI of 2.0 (this would be due to data hazards, control hazards, and structural hazards):
- MIPS = 8,700 MHz / 2 = **4,350 MIPS**

A more realistic estimate can be calculated by considering the specific hazards:
- Data hazards: mitigated by forwarding, but load-use hazards still cause 1-cycle stalls
- Branch hazards: each misprediction causes a 3-cycle penalty
- Assuming 20% of instructions are affected by hazards with an average penalty of 1.5 cycles:
  - Effective CPI = 1 + (0.2 × 1.5) = 1.3
  - MIPS = 8,700 MHz / 1.3 = **6,692 MIPS**

### Component Selection for Heat Reduction

The packaging team has asked us to identify one component that can run slower to reduce heat dissipation. Let's analyze our options:

#### For Single-Cycle MIPS

The critical path is 333 ps for the store instruction. Any component not on this critical path (or with "slack" in the critical path) can be slowed down.

**Best choices:**
1. **Data Memory Write**: Since the critical path involves data memory write (90 ps), we could slow it down slightly (e.g., to 95-100 ps) without affecting overall performance.

2. **Register File Write**: This is at the end of the critical path. If all instructions need to write to the register file, slowing it down would affect performance. However, store instructions don't write to the register file, so for them, the register file write speed doesn't matter. This means we could potentially slow down register file writes without affecting the critical path.

**Justification**: If we choose the register file write, we can slow it from 40 ps to approximately 70 ps (a 75% increase in time) without affecting performance, since store instructions (which form our critical path) don't use register file writes.

#### For Multi-Cycle MIPS

The critical path is 115 ps in the ALU operation stage.

**Best choice**: Any component not in the ALU operation stage can be slowed down without affecting the critical path.

**ALU**: Since the ALU is the major component in the critical path (100 ps out of 115 ps), we have very little room to slow it down.

**Memory Write**: The memory write takes 90 ps in a stage with a total delay of 98 ps. We could slow it down to about 107 ps (a 19% increase) without making it the new critical path.

**Justification**: Memory write can be slowed from 90 ps to 107 ps without making memory access the critical path stage.

#### For Pipelined MIPS

Similar to multi-cycle, the critical path is 115 ps in the EX stage.

**Best choice**: Any component not in the EX stage can be slowed down.

**Memory Write**: As with multi-cycle, this can be slowed from 90 ps to 107 ps.

**Register File Read**: Currently 30 ps in a stage with total delay of 41 ps. It could be slowed to about 104 ps (a 247% increase) without making ID the critical stage.

**Justification**: Register file read time can be increased dramatically without affecting the critical path, making it an excellent choice for reducing power consumption.

## Branch Prediction

### Branch Prediction Strategies

Branch prediction is crucial for maintaining pipeline efficiency when dealing with control hazards. Here are the main strategies:

#### 1. Static Branch Prediction

**Always-Not-Taken Strategy:**
- Predict that branches are never taken
- Continue fetching instructions sequentially
- Simple to implement, but performs poorly for loops

**Always-Taken Strategy:**
- Predict that branches are always taken
- Start fetching from the branch target immediately
- Better for backward branches (loops) but worse for forward branches

**Based on Branch Direction:**
- Backward branches (negative displacement) predicted taken
- Forward branches (positive displacement) predicted not taken
- Exploits the observation that backward branches are often for loops

#### 2. Dynamic Branch Prediction

**1-bit Predictor:**
- Remember the last outcome of each branch
- If the branch was taken last time, predict taken; otherwise, predict not taken
- Simple, but performs poorly for loops (mispredicts twice per loop)

**2-bit Predictor (Saturating Counter):**
- Use a 2-bit counter per branch with four states:
  - Strongly Not Taken (00)
  - Weakly Not Taken (01)
  - Weakly Taken (10)
  - Strongly Taken (11)
- When branch is taken, counter moves toward Strongly Taken
- When branch is not taken, counter moves toward Strongly Not Taken
- Provides hysteresis, needing two consecutive wrong predictions to change direction

**Correlating Predictors:**
- Consider the outcomes of previous branches
- Exploit correlation between different branches
- Example: (2,2) predictor uses last 2 branches to index into a table of 2-bit counters

**Tournament Predictors:**
- Use multiple predictors simultaneously
- A "meta-predictor" learns which predictor to trust for each branch
- Used in modern high-performance processors

### Performance Impact of Branch Prediction

Let's solve the branch prediction problem from the homework:

Given:
- Mispredictions need a 4-cycle stall
- Branch prediction algorithm has 95% accuracy
- 1/7 of all instructions are branches
- MIPS pipelined architecture running at 2 GHz
- All data hazards are handled by forwarding

#### Step 1: Calculate the branch misprediction rate
- Branch frequency = 1/7 ≈ 0.143 or 14.3% of all instructions
- Prediction accuracy = 95%
- Misprediction rate = 5% of all branches
- Overall misprediction frequency = 0.143 × 0.05 = 0.00715 or 0.715% of all instructions

#### Step 2: Calculate the CPI impact
- Base CPI for ideal pipeline = 1
- CPI penalty per misprediction = 4 cycles
- CPI increase due to mispredictions = 0.00715 × 4 = 0.0286
- Effective CPI = 1 + 0.0286 = 1.0286

#### Step 3: Calculate throughput
- Clock rate = 2 GHz = 2 × 10^9 instructions/second (in ideal case)
- Actual throughput = Clock rate / CPI = (2 × 10^9) / 1.0286 ≈ 1.944 × 10^9 instructions/second
- Throughput = **1.944 BIPS (Billion Instructions Per Second)** or **1,944 MIPS**

#### Verification
We can verify this another way:
- 2 GHz processor ideally executes 2 billion instructions per second
- With 0.715% of instructions causing a 4-cycle penalty:
  - Total cycles for 2 billion instructions = 2 billion × 1 + (2 billion × 0.00715 × 4)
  - = 2 billion + 57.2 million
  - = 2.0572 billion cycles
- Execution time = 2.0572 billion cycles / 2 GHz = 1.0286 seconds
- Throughput = 2 billion instructions / 1.0286 seconds ≈ 1.944 BIPS

## Interrupts and Exceptions

Interrupts and exceptions are mechanisms that allow the processor to handle unexpected or exceptional events. While there are no specific homework problems on this topic, understanding the concepts is essential.

### Interrupt Handling

#### Types of Interrupts

1. **External Interrupts**: Generated by I/O devices, timers, or other external components
   - Example: A keyboard sends an interrupt when a key is pressed

2. **Software Interrupts**: Generated by executing specific instructions
   - Example: System calls in operating systems

#### Interrupt Handling Process

1. **Detection**: The processor detects an interrupt request
2. **Completion**: The current instruction completes execution
3. **State Saving**: The processor saves the current state (PC, registers)
4. **Vector Lookup**: The processor determines the address of the interrupt handler
5. **Handler Execution**: The interrupt handler executes
6. **State Restoration**: The processor restores the saved state
7. **Return**: The processor returns to the interrupted program

### Exception Handling

#### Types of Exceptions

1. **Synchronous Exceptions**: Directly related to instruction execution
   - Example: Division by zero, undefined opcode

2. **Asynchronous Exceptions**: Not directly related to the instruction stream
   - Example: Hardware errors, power failure

#### Exception Handling Process

The exception handling process is similar to interrupt handling, with some differences:

1. **Detection**: The processor detects an exception condition
2. **State Saving**: Saves the current state, including information about the cause
3. **Handler Execution**: Transfers control to the appropriate exception handler
4. **Recovery or Termination**: The handler may:
   - Fix the problem and resume execution
   - Terminate the program
   - Take other appropriate action

#### MIPS Exception Handling Architecture

In MIPS, exceptions are handled using:

1. **Exception Program Counter (EPC)**: Stores the address of the instruction that caused the exception or the address of the next instruction to execute after handling the exception

2. **Cause Register**: Indicates the cause of the exception

3. **Status Register**: Contains control bits that affect the exception handling process

4. **Exception Vector**: A fixed memory address where the exception handler starts

## Real Numbers

### IEEE 754 Floating Point Format

The IEEE 754 standard defines formats for representing floating-point numbers in binary. The most common formats are single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit).

#### Single-Precision (32-bit) Format

The 32-bit format consists of:
- **Sign bit** (1 bit): 0 for positive, 1 for negative
- **Exponent** (8 bits): Biased exponent (actual exponent + 127)
- **Fraction** (23 bits): Represents the fractional part of the significand

The value is calculated as: (-1)^sign × (1.fraction) × 2^(exponent-127)

#### Special Values

- **Zero**: sign = 0/1, exponent = 0, fraction = 0
- **Infinity**: sign = 0/1, exponent = 255, fraction = 0
- **NaN (Not a Number)**: exponent = 255, fraction ≠ 0
- **Denormalized Numbers**: exponent = 0, fraction ≠ 0

#### Example: Converting Decimal to IEEE 754

Let's convert 0.15625 to single-precision IEEE 754:

1. **Convert to binary**:
   0.15625 = 0.00101 in binary

2. **Normalize**:
   0.00101 = 1.01 × 2^(-3)

3. **Calculate biased exponent**:
   -3 + 127 = 124 = 01111100 in binary

4. **Extract fraction**:
   Fraction = 01000...0 (the bits after the implied 1)

5. **Compose the format**:
   - Sign = 0 (positive)
   - Exponent = 01111100
   - Fraction = 01000...0
   
   Final representation: 0 01111100 01000000000000000000000
   Hex: 0x3E400000

#### Example: Converting a Large Number

Let's convert 6.022 × 10^23 (Avogadro's number) to IEEE 754:

1. **Convert to binary**:
   6.022 × 10^23 ≈ 6.022 × 2^79 (since 10^23 ≈ 2^76.4 and 6.022 ≈ 2^2.6)
   ≈ 1.5 × 2^81

2. **Normalize**:
   1.5 in binary is 1.1

3. **Calculate biased exponent**:
   81 + 127 = 208 = 11010000 in binary

4. **Extract fraction**:
   Fraction = 10000...0 (the bits after the implied 1)

5. **Compose the format**:
   - Sign = 0 (positive)
   - Exponent = 11010000
   - Fraction = 10000...0
   
   Final representation: 0 11010000 10000000000000000000000
   Hex: 0x6A800000

#### Example: Converting a Very Small Number

Let's convert 1.6 × 10^(-35) to IEEE 754:

1. **Convert to binary**:
   1.6 × 10^(-35) ≈ 1.6 × 2^(-116) (since 10^(-35) ≈ 2^(-116.3) and 1.6 ≈ 2^0.7)

2. **Normalize**:
   1.6 in binary is approximately 1.10011001100...

3. **Calculate biased exponent**:
   -116 + 127 = 11 = 00001011 in binary

4. **Extract fraction**:
   Fraction = 10011001100... (the bits after the implied 1)

5. **Compose the format**:
   - Sign = 0 (positive)
   - Exponent = 00001011
   - Fraction = 10011001100...
   
   Final representation: 0 00001011 10011001100...
   Hex: 0x0599999A (approximate)

### Fixed Point Representation

Fixed-point representation allocates a fixed number of bits for the integer part and a fixed number of bits for the fractional part.

#### Fixed Point Format

A common way to denote fixed-point format is Q(m).(n), where:
- m is the number of bits for the integer part (including sign bit)
- n is the number of bits for the fractional part

Total bits = m + n

#### Example: Q8.8 Format

In Q8.8 format:
- 8 bits for integer part (including sign)
- 8 bits for fractional part
- Total of 16 bits

The range is approximately -128 to +127.99609375 with a precision of 2^(-8) = 0.00390625.

#### Example: Converting Decimal to Q8.8

Let's convert 42.75 to Q8.8 format:

1. **Convert integer part to binary**:
   42 = 00101010 in binary (using 8 bits)

2. **Convert fractional part to binary**:
   0.75 = 0.75 × 2 = 1.5 → 1
         0.5 × 2 = 1.0 → 1
   0.75 = 0.11 in binary

3. **Combine**:
   42.75 = 00101010.11 in binary

4. **Pad to fit format**:
   Q8.8 = 00101010.11000000

5. **Final representation**:
   0010101011000000 (binary)
   0x2AC0 (hex)

#### Example: Q16.16 Format for Larger Range

For a larger range with higher precision, Q16.16 is common:
- 16 bits for integer part (including sign)
- 16 bits for fractional part
- Total of 32 bits

The range is approximately -32,768 to +32,767.999985 with a precision of 2^(-16) ≈ 0.0000153.

#### Example: Converting Decimal to Q16.16

Let's convert 3.14159 to Q16.16 format:

1. **Convert integer part to binary**:
   3 = 0000000000000011 in binary (using 16 bits)

2. **Convert fractional part to binary**:
   0.14159 × 2 = 0.28318 → 0
   0.28318 × 2 = 0.56636 → 0
   0.56636 × 2 = 1.13272 → 1
   0.13272 × 2 = 0.26544 → 0
   ... (continue this process)
   
   0.14159 ≈ 0.0010010001111010111... in binary

3. **Combine and pad**:
   3.14159 ≈ 0000000000000011.0010010001111011...
   
   Q16.16 = 0000000000000011.0010010001111011...

4. **Final representation** (approximated to Q16.16):
   00000000000000110010010001111011 (binary)
   0x00033421 (hex)

### Fixed Point vs. Floating Point

#### Advantages of Fixed Point
- Simpler and faster arithmetic operations
- No need for normalization or exponent handling
- Consistent precision across the entire range

#### Advantages of Floating Point
- Much wider dynamic range
- Better precision for very large or very small numbers
- Standard representation (IEEE 754) widely implemented in hardware

#### When to Use Each
- **Fixed Point**: When known range and precision requirements, performance critical applications, embedded systems without FPU
- **Floating Point**: Scientific computing, general-purpose calculations, wide dynamic range needed

## Microcoding

### Microcoded vs. Hardwired Control

#### Hardwired Control
- Implements control functions directly in hardware logic
- Fixed control logic, difficult to change
- Faster execution but less flexible
- Uses combinational logic circuits

#### Microcoded Control
- Implements control functions as microcode stored in memory
- Control signals generated by executing microinstructions
- More flexible but typically slower
- Uses micro-operations stored in control store

### Implementing JR with Microcode

The JR (Jump Register) instruction in MIPS jumps to the address contained in a register (rs).

#### Instruction Format
JR is an R-type instruction:
- opcode = 000000
- rs = register containing target address
- rt = 00000
- rd = 00000
- shamt = 00000
- funct = 001000

#### Microcode Implementation

To implement JR using microcode, we need to modify the microcode table (Fig 5.7.3) to include the JR instruction. Here's how we could implement it:

1. **Fetch Cycle** (same for all instructions):
   - Read instruction from memory
   - Increment PC
   - Decode instruction

2. **JR-specific microcode**:
   - Read rs from register file
   - Load PC with value from rs
   - Jump to fetch cycle for next instruction

#### Detailed Microcode Sequence

For a typical microcode implementation, we might have these microinstructions:

**Microinstruction 1** (Fetch - common to all instructions):
- IorD = 0 (memory address from PC)
- IRWrite = 1 (write to instruction register)
- ALUSrcA = 0 (ALU input A from PC)
- ALUSrcB = 01 (ALU input B is 4)
- ALUOp = 00 (add operation)
- PCWrite = 1 (write to PC)
- PCSource = 00 (next PC from ALU)

**Microinstruction 2** (Decode - leads to instruction-specific sequence):
- ALUSrcA = 0 (ALU input A not used)
- ALUSrcB = 00 (ALU input B not used)
- ALUOp = 00 (not used)
- Branch to instruction-specific microcode based on opcode/funct fields

**Microinstruction 3** (JR execution):
- ALUSrcA = 1 (ALU input A from register A, which contains rs)
- ALUSrcB = 00 (ALU input B not used, we just want to pass through rs)
- ALUOp = 00 (pass-through operation)
- PCWrite = 1 (write to PC)
- PCSource = 00 (PC from ALU result)
- Branch to fetch microinstruction

#### Dispatch Table Modifications

We need to modify the dispatch table to recognize the JR instruction (opcode 000000, funct 001000) and branch to the JR-specific microcode.

The dispatch logic needs to examine both the opcode (for R-type instructions) and the funct field (for specific R-type operations). The entry for JR would point to the address of Microinstruction 3 above.

### Performance Analysis of Microcoded Implementation

Given:
- Microcode storage: 25 ps
- Adder: 15 ps
- Everything else: negligible

Let's analyze the performance of a microcoded implementation:

#### Critical Path for Each Microinstruction
Each microinstruction execution involves:
1. Fetching the microinstruction from microcode storage: 25 ps
2. Executing the microinstruction (adder operations): 15 ps
3. Total per microinstruction: 40 ps

#### Instruction Execution Time
For a typical instruction like JR, we need 3 microinstructions:
- Fetch microinstruction: 40 ps
- Decode microinstruction: 40 ps
- JR-specific microinstruction: 40 ps
- Total: 120 ps

#### Clock Rate Calculation
Since each microinstruction takes 40 ps to execute, the maximum clock rate is:
Clock rate = 1 / 40 ps = 25 GHz

However, this is the microinstruction clock rate. The instruction execution rate depends on the number of microinstructions per instruction.

#### Effective CPI
With an average of 3-5 microinstructions per machine instruction, the effective CPI is:
- R-type: ~4 microinstructions
- Load: ~5 microinstructions
- Store: ~4 microinstructions
- Branch: ~4 microinstructions
- Jump: ~3 microinstructions

Using our instruction mix:
- Average microinstructions = (64% × 4) + (15% × 4) + (10% × 5) + (6% × 4) + (5% × 3)
- = 2.56 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.24 + 0.15
- = 4.05 microinstructions per instruction

#### Effective MIPS Rating
MIPS = Clock rate / (Microinstructions per instruction)
= 25,000 MHz / 4.05
= 6,173 MIPS

### Pros and Cons of Microcoded MIPS

#### Advantages of Microcoding

1. **Flexibility**: Easy to add or modify instructions without changing hardware

2. **Simplicity**: Control logic is programmed rather than hardwired, simplifying hardware design

3. **Maintainability**: Bugs can be fixed by updating microcode, not redesigning hardware

4. **Complex Instructions**: Facilitates implementation of complex instructions that require many steps

5. **Reduced Control Logic**: Less hardwired control logic means smaller chip area for control

6. **Uniformity**: All instructions broken down into similar microoperations

#### Disadvantages of Microcoding

1. **Performance Overhead**: Each instruction requires multiple microinstructions, reducing performance

2. **Memory Access Latency**: Accessing microcode memory adds delay to every cycle

3. **Additional Hardware**: Requires microcode storage and sequencing logic

4. **Power Consumption**: Additional memory accesses increase power usage

#### Analysis Based on Performance Results

From our performance analysis:
- Microcoded implementation: 6,173 MIPS
- Single-cycle: 3,000 MIPS
- Multi-cycle: 2,231 MIPS
- Pipelined: 6,692 MIPS (realistic estimate)

Our microcoded implementation performs surprisingly well due to the very fast microcode storage (25 ps) and adder (15 ps) compared to the components in the other architectures. However, this is probably not realistic in practice.

In real-world processors:
1. Microcode storage typically has higher latency
2. The simplification of using just microcode storage and adder times ignores many real-world complexities
3. Microcode implementation often has higher power consumption

**Conclusion**: While our simplified analysis shows good performance for the microcoded implementation, in practice, pipelined implementations with hardwired control tend to offer better performance, which is why most modern high-performance processors use hardwired control with pipelining, reserving microcode only for complex, rarely-used instructions.

## Final Exam Preparation Tips

Since this material constitutes 20% of the exam, focus on understanding:

1. **Critical Path Analysis**: Be able to identify the longest path through each architecture and calculate the maximum clock rate.

2. **Performance Calculations**: Practice calculating MIPS ratings and understanding how different factors (CPI, clock rate) affect performance.

3. **Branch Prediction**: Understand the impact of branch prediction on performance and be able to calculate throughput with given prediction accuracy.

4. **Number Representation**: Be comfortable converting between decimal and IEEE 754 floating point or fixed-point formats.

5. **Microcoding**: Understand the trade-offs between microcoded and hardwired control, and be able to implement simple instructions using microcode.

Remember that many questions may combine concepts, such as analyzing performance implications of different design choices. Always show your work and explain your reasoning, especially when justifying which components could be slowed down without affecting performance.

**Due Thursday, May 8, before class**

**Readings: All of chapter 9 except for 9.3.4, 9.3.6, 9.4, 9.6.**

**1) Textbook question 9.1. You don't need to show the steps of the algorithm, you can just write out the answer.**

**2) Textbook question 9.5a. Write out the full sequence of tables as shown on pages 394-396.**

**3) Textbook question 9.7a**

**4) Textbook question 9.15a. For Prim's, write out the tables as shown on p.415-417. For Kruskal's, write out the single table as shown on p.417.**

**5) The Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Johnson's algorithm are two algorithms used to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem. Floyd-Warshall runs in Θ(|V|3) while Johnson's algorithm runs in O(|V|2 log |V| + |V||E|).**

**Which algorithm is best in each of the following cases? Justify each answer.**

**a) A graph of size n where each vertex has an average of 20 neighbors.**

**b) A graph of size n where each vertex is neighbor with 10% of all vertices.**

**c) A graph of size n where each vertex has (square root of n) neighbors.**

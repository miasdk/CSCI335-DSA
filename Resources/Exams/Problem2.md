Suppose you have two lists of chemicals - for example, an "approved" list and a "banned" list. The lists are implemented as vectors, and the chemicals as strings. You want to write a function that can move a given chemical from one list to the other.
Implement the following function that moves *chemical* from *source* to *targ* using efficient move semantics. If *chemical* is found in *source* and not found in *targ*, it is moved and 1 is returned. Otherwise, nothing is moved and 0 is returned. If source and targ are the same, 1 is returned. Iterators must be used wherever appropriate

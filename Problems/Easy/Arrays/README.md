-   **Naive Approach**: O(n^2) time complexity due to repeated shifting of elements. Inefficient for large vectors.

-   **Optimized Approach**: O(n) time complexity. Efficient for large vectors, but slightly more complex code.

-   **Optimal Approach**: O(n) time complexity. Efficient for large vectors and simpler/more readable code.
